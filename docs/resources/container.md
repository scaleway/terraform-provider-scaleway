# Resource: scaleway_container

The `scaleway_container` resource allows you to create and manage [Serverless Containers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/containers/).

Refer to the Serverless Containers [product documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/containers/) and [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/) for more information.

For more information on the limitations of Serverless Containers, refer to the [dedicated documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource scaleway_container_namespace main {
    name = "my-ns-test"
    description = "test container"
}

resource scaleway_container main {
    name = "my-container-02"
    description = "environment variables test"
    namespace_id = scaleway_container_namespace.main.id
    registry_image = "${scaleway_container_namespace.main.registry_endpoint}/alpine:test"
    port = 9997
    cpu_limit = 140
    memory_limit = 256
    min_scale = 3
    max_scale = 5
    timeout = 600
    max_concurrency = 80
    privacy = "private"
    protocol = "http1"
    deploy = true

    environment_variables = {
        "foo" = "var"
    }
    secret_environment_variables = {
      "key" = "secret"
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `name` - (Required) The unique name of the container name.

- `namespace_id` - (Required) The Containers namespace ID of the container.

~> **Important** Updating the `name` argument will recreate the container.

- `description` (Optional) The description of the container.

- `environment_variables` - (Optional) The [environment variables](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/containers/concepts/#environment-variables) of the container.

- `secret_environment_variables` - (Optional) The [secret environment variables](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/containers/concepts/#secrets) of the container.

- `min_scale` - (Optional) The minimum number of container instances running continuously.

- `max_scale` - (Optional) The maximum number of instances this container can scale to.

- `memory_limit` - (Optional) The memory resources in MB to allocate to each container.

- `cpu_limit` - (Optional) The amount of vCPU computing resources to allocate to each container.

- `timeout` - (Optional) The maximum amount of time your container can spend processing a request before being stopped.

- `privacy` - (Optional) The privacy type defines the way to authenticate to your container. Please check our dedicated [section](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#protocol-9dd4c8).

- `registry_image` - (Optional) The registry image address (e.g., `rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/$NAMESPACE/$IMAGE`)

- `registry_sha256` - (Optional) The sha256 of your source registry image, changing it will re-apply the deployment. Can be any string.

- `max_concurrency` - (Optional) The maximum number of simultaneous requests your container can handle at the same time.

- `protocol` - (Optional) The communication [protocol](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#path-containers-update-an-existing-container) `http1` or `h2c`. Defaults to `http1`.

- `http_option` - (Optional) Allows both HTTP and HTTPS (`enabled`) or redirect HTTP to HTTPS (`redirected`). Defaults to `enabled`.

- `sandbox` - (Optional) Execution environment of the container.

- `scaling_option` - (Optional) Configuration block used to decide when to scale up or down. Possible values:
    - `concurrent_requests_threshold` - Scale depending on the number of concurrent requests being processed per container instance.
    - `cpu_usage_threshold` - Scale depending on the CPU usage of a container instance.
    - `memory_usage_threshold`- Scale depending on the memory usage of a container instance.

- `port` - (Optional) The port to expose the container.

- `deploy` - (Optional) Boolean indicating whether the container is in a production environment.

Note that if you want to use your own configuration, you must consult our configuration [restrictions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/#configuration-restrictions) section.

## Attributes Reference

The `scaleway_container` resource exports certain attributes once the Container is retrieved. These attributes can be referenced in other parts of your Terraform configuration.

- `id` - The unique identifier of the container.

~> **Important:** Container IDs are [regional](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#resource-ids), which means they are of the form `{region}/{id}`, e.g. `fr-par/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`.

- `region` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#region) `region`) The [region](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#regions) in which the container was created.

- `status` - The container status.

- `cron_status` - The cron status of the container.

- `error_message` - The error message of the container.

- `domain_name` - The native domain name of the container

## Import

Containers can be imported using, `{region}/{id}`, as shown below:

```bash
terraform import scaleway_container.main fr-par/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

## Protocols

The following protocols are supported:

* `h2c`: HTTP/2 over TCP.
* `http1`: Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

~> **Important:** Refer to the official [Apache documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/http2.html) for more information.

## Privacy

By default, creating a container will make it `public`, meaning that anybody knowing the endpoint can execute it.

A container can be made `private` with the privacy parameter.

Refer to the [technical information](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#protocol-9dd4c8) for more information on container authentication.

## Memory and vCPUs configuration

The vCPU represents a portion of the underlying, physical CPU that is assigned to a particular virtual machine (VM).

You can determine the computing resources to allocate to each container.

The `memory_limit` (in MB) must correspond with the right amount of vCPU. Refer to the table below to determine the right memory/vCPU combination.

| Memory (in MB) | vCPU |
|----------------|------|
| 128            | 70m  |
| 256            | 140m |
| 512            | 280m |
| 1024           | 560m |
| 2048           | 1120 |
| 3072           | 1680 |
| 4096           | 2240 |

~>**Important:** Make sure to select the right resources, as you will be billed based on compute usage over time and the number of Containers executions.
Refer to the [Serverless Containers pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/faq/serverless-containers/#prices) for more information.

## Scaling option configuration

Scaling option block configuration allows you to choose which parameter will scale up/down containers. Options are number of concurrent requests, CPU or memory usage. 
It replaces current `max_concurrency` that has been deprecated.

Example:

```terraform
resource scaleway_container main {
    name = "my-container-02"
    namespace_id = scaleway_container_namespace.main.id

    scaling_option {
      concurrent_requests_threshold = 15
    }
}
```

~>**Important**: A maximum of one of these parameters may be set. Also, when `cpu_usage_threshold` or `memory_usage_threshold` are used, `min_scale` can't be set to 0.
Refer to the [API Reference](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#path-containers-create-a-new-container) for more information.
