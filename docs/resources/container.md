# Resource: scaleway_container

The `scaleway_container` resource allows you to create and manage [Serverless Containers](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/containers/).

Refer to the Serverless Containers [product documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless/containers/) and [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/) for more information.

For more information on the limitations of Serverless Containers, refer to the [dedicated documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource scaleway_container_namespace main {
    name = "my-ns-test"
    description = "test container"
}

resource scaleway_container main {
    name = "my-container-02"
    description = "environment variables test"
    namespace_id = scaleway_container_namespace.main.id
    registry_image = "${scaleway_container_namespace.main.registry_endpoint}/alpine:test"
    port = 9997
    cpu_limit = 140
    memory_limit = 256
    min_scale = 3
    max_scale = 5
    timeout = 600
    max_concurrency = 80
    privacy = "private"
    protocol = "http1"
    deploy = true

    environment_variables = {
        "foo" = "var"
    }
    secret_environment_variables = {
      "key" = "secret"
    }
}
```

- `timeout` - (Optional) The maximum amount of time your container can spend processing a request before being stopped.

- `privacy` - (Optional) The privacy type defines the way to authenticate to your container. Please check our dedicated [section](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#protocol-9dd4c8).

- `registry_image` - (Optional) The registry image address (e.g., `rg.fr-par.scw.cloud/$NAMESPACE/$IMAGE`)

- `registry_sha256` - (Optional) The sha256 of your source registry image, changing it will re-apply the deployment. Can be any string.

- `max_concurrency` - (Optional) The maximum number of simultaneous requests your container can handle at the same time.

- `protocol` - (Optional) The communication [protocol](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#path-containers-update-an-existing-container) `http1` or `h2c`. Defaults to `http1`.

- `http_option` - (Optional) Allows both HTTP and HTTPS (`enabled`) or redirect HTTP to HTTPS (`redirected`). Defaults to `enabled`.

- `sandbox` - (Optional) Execution environment of the container.

- `heath_check` - (Optional) Health check configuration block of the container.
    - `http` - HTTP health check configuration.
        - `path` - Path to use for the HTTP health check.    
    - `failure_threshold` - Number of consecutive health check failures before considering the container unhealthy.
    - `interval`- Period between health checks (in seconds).

- `port` - (Optional) The port to expose the container.

- `deploy` - (Optional) Boolean indicating whether the container is in a production environment.

Note that if you want to use your own configuration, you must consult our configuration [restrictions](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/serverless-containers/reference-content/containers-limitations/#configuration-restrictions) section.

## Attributes Reference

The `scaleway_container` resource exports certain attributes once the Container is retrieved. These attributes can be referenced in other parts of your Terraform configuration.

- `id` - The unique identifier of the container.

~> **Important:** Container IDs are [regional](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#resource-ids), which means they are of the form `{region}/{id}`, e.g. `fr-par/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`.

- `region` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#region) `region`) The [region](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#regions) in which the container was created.

- `status` - The container status.

- `cron_status` - The cron status of the container.

- `error_message` - The error message of the container.

- `domain_name` - The native domain name of the container

## Import

Containers can be imported using, `{region}/{id}`, as shown below:

```bash
terraform import scaleway_container.main fr-par/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```

## Protocols

The following protocols are supported:

* `h2c`: HTTP/2 over TCP.
* `http1`: Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

~> **Important:** Refer to the official [Apache documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/http2.html) for more information.

## Privacy

By default, creating a container will make it `public`, meaning that anybody knowing the endpoint can execute it.

A container can be made `private` with the privacy parameter.

Refer to the [technical information](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#protocol-9dd4c8) for more information on container authentication.

## Memory and vCPUs configuration

The vCPU represents a portion of the underlying, physical CPU that is assigned to a particular virtual machine (VM).

You can determine the computing resources to allocate to each container.

The `memory_limit` (in MB) must correspond with the right amount of vCPU. Refer to the table below to determine the right memory/vCPU combination.

| Memory (in MB) | vCPU |
|----------------|------|
| 128            | 70m  |
| 256            | 140m |
| 512            | 280m |
| 1024           | 560m |
| 2048           | 1120 |
| 3072           | 1680 |
| 4096           | 2240 |

~>**Important:** Make sure to select the right resources, as you will be billed based on compute usage over time and the number of Containers executions.
Refer to the [Serverless Containers pricing](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/faq/serverless-containers/#prices) for more information.

## Health check configuration

Custom health checks can be configured on the container. 

It's possible to specify the HTTP path that the probe will listen to and the number of failures before considering the container as unhealthy. 
During a deployment, if a newly created container fails to pass the health check, the deployment is aborted. 
As a result, lowering this value can help to reduce the time it takes to detect a failed deployment. 
The period between health checks is also configurable.

Example:

```terraform
resource scaleway_container main {
    name = "my-container-02"
    namespace_id = scaleway_container_namespace.main.id

    health_check {
        http {
            path = "/ping"
        }
        failure_threshold = 40
        interval = "3s"
    }
}
```

~>**Important:** Another probe type can be set to TCP with the API, but currently the SDK has not been updated with this parameter.
This is why the only probe that can be used here is the HTTP probe.
Refer to the [API Reference](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-containers/#path-containers-create-a-new-container) for more information.
