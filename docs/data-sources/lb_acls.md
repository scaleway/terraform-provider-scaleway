## Example Usage

```hcl
# Find acls that share the same frontend ID
data "scaleway_lb_acls" "byFrontID" {
  frontend_id = "${scaleway_lb_frontend.frt01.id}"
}
# Find acls by frontend ID and name
data "scaleway_lb_acls" "byFrontID_and_name" {
  frontend_id = "${scaleway_lb_frontend.frt01.id}"
  name        = "tf-acls-datasource"
}
```

## Argument Reference

  ~> **Important:** LB frontend IDs are [zoned](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#resource-ids), which means they are of the form `{zone}/{id}`, e.g. `fr-par-1/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`

- `name` - (Optional) The ACL name to filter for. ACLs with a matching name are listed.
