# scaleway_block_volume

The `scaleway_block_volume` data source is used to retrieve information about a Block Storage volume.

## Retrieve a Block Storage volume

The following commands allow you to:

- retrieve a Block Storage volume specified by its name
- retrieve a Block Storage volume specified by its ID


```terraform
// Get info by volume name
data "scaleway_block_volume" "my_volume" {
  name = "my-name"
}

// Get info by volume ID
data "scaleway_block_volume" "my_volume" {
  volume_id = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
}
```

## Argument Reference
