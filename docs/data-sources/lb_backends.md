# scaleway_lb_backends

Gets information about multiple Load Balancer Backends.

For more information, see the [main documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/load-balancer/reference-content/configuring-backends/) or [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/load-balancer/zoned-api/#path-backends).

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Find backends that share the same LB ID
data "scaleway_lb_backends" "byLBID" {
  lb_id = "${scaleway_lb.lb01.id}"
}
# Find backends by LB ID and name
data "scaleway_lb_backends" "byLBID_and_name" {
  lb_id = "${scaleway_lb.lb01.id}"
  name  = "tf-backend-datasource"
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `lb_id` - (Required) The Load Balancer ID this backend is attached to. Backends with a matching ID are listed.

- `name` - (Optional) The backend name to filter for. Backends with a matching name are listed.

- `zone` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#zone) `zone`) The [zone](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#zones) in which backends exist.
