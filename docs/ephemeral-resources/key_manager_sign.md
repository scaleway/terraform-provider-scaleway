# scaleway_key_manager_sign (Ephemeral Resource)

The [`scaleway_key_manager_sign`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/scaleway/scaleway/latest/docs/ephemeral-resource/key_manager_sign) ephemeral resource is helpful to sign a message digest with a given key. The key must have its usage set to asymmetric_signing. The digest must be created using the same digest algorithm that is defined in the key's algorithm configuration.

Refer to the Key Manager [documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/key-manager/) and [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/key-manager/) for more information.
