# scaleway_baremetal_server

Gets information about a baremetal server.
For more information, see the [API documentation](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/baremetal/api).

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Get info by server name
data "scaleway_baremetal_server" "by_name" {
  name = "foobar"
  zone = "fr-par-2"
}

# Get info by server id
data "scaleway_baremetal_server" "by_id" {
  server_id = "11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111"
}
```

## Argument Reference

- `name` - (Optional) The server name. Only one of `name` and `server_id` should be specified.
- `zone` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#zone) `zone`) The [zone](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#zones) in which the server exists.
- `project_id` - (Optional) The ID of the project the baremetal server is associated with.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all above arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The ID of the server.

The `scaleway_baremetal_server` data source exports certain attributes once the baremetal server information is retrieved. These attributes can be referenced in other parts of your Terraform configuration. The exported attributes are those that come from the `scaleway_baremetal_server` [resource](../resources/baremetal_server.md)

~> **Important:** Baremetal servers' IDs are [zoned](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#resource-ids), which means they are of the form `{zone}/{id}`, e.g. `fr-par-1/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`
