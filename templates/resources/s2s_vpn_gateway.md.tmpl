Creates and manages Scaleway Site-to-Site VPN Gateways.
For more information, see [the main documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/site-to-site-vpn/reference-content/understanding-s2svpn/).

## Example Usage

### Basic

```terraform
resource "scaleway_vpc" "vpc" {
name = "my-vpc"
}

resource "scaleway_vpc_private_network" "pn" {
name   = "my-private-network"
vpc_id = scaleway_vpc.vpc.id
ipv4_subnet {
subnet = "10.0.1.0/24"
}
}

resource "scaleway_s2s_vpn_gateway" "gateway" {
name              = "my-vpn-gateway"
gateway_type      = "VGW-S"
private_network_id = scaleway_vpc_private_network.pn.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `gateway_type` - (Required) The VPN gateway type (commercial offer type).
- `private_network_id` - (Required) The ID of the Private Network to attach to the VPN gateway.
- `name` - (Optional) The name of the VPN gateway. If not provided, it will be randomly generated.
- `tags` - (Optional) The list of tags to apply to the VPN gateway.
- `public_config` - (Optional) The public endpoint configuration of the VPN gateway. See [Public Config](#public-config) below.
- `ipam_private_ipv4_id` - (Optional) The ID of the IPAM private IPv4 address to attach to the VPN gateway.
- `ipam_private_ipv6_id` - (Optional) The ID of the IPAM private IPv6 address to attach to the VPN gateway.
- `region` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#region) `region`) The [region](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#regions) in which the VPN gateway should be created.
- `zone` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#zone) `zone`) The [zone](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#zones) in which the VPN gateway should be created.
- `project_id` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#project_id) `project_id`) The ID of the project the VPN gateway is associated with.

### Public Config

The `public_config` block supports:

- `ipam_ipv4_id` - (Optional) The ID of the IPAM IPv4 address to use as the public IP for the VPN gateway.
- `ipam_ipv6_id` - (Optional) The ID of the IPAM IPv6 address to use as the public IP for the VPN gateway.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The ID of the VPN gateway.
- `asn` - The AS Number of the VPN gateway (typically 12876 for Scaleway).
- `status` - The status of the VPN gateway.
- `public_config` - The public endpoint configuration, including the assigned public IPs.
- `created_at` - The date and time of the creation of the VPN gateway (RFC 3339 format).
- `updated_at` - The date and time of the last update of the VPN gateway (RFC 3339 format).
- `organization_id` - The Organization ID the VPN gateway is associated with.

~> **Important:** VPN Gateways' IDs are [regional](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#resource-ids), which means they are of the form `{region}/{id}`, e.g. `fr-par/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`

## Import

VPN Gateways can be imported using `{region}/{id}`, e.g.

```bash
terraform import scaleway_s2s_vpn_gateway.main fr-par/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```
