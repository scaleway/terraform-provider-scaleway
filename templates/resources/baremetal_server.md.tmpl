## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `offer` - (Required) The offer UUID of the baremetal server.
  Use [this endpoint](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/elastic-metal/#path-servers-get-a-specific-elastic-metal-server) to find the right offer.

~> **Important:** Updates to `offer` will recreate the server.

- `os` - (Required) The UUID of the os to install on the server.
  Use [this endpoint](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/elastic-metal/#path-os-list-available-oses) to find the right OS ID.
  ~> **Important:** Updates to `os` will reinstall the server.
- `ssh_key_ids` - (Required) List of SSH keys allowed to connect to the server.
- `user` - (Optional) User used for the installation.
- `password` - (Optional) Password used for the installation. May be required depending on used os. Only one of `password` or `password_wo` should be specified.
- `password_wo` - (Optional) Password used for the installation in [write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/write-only) mode. Only one of `password` or `password_wo` should be specified. `password_wo` will not be set in the Terraform state. To update the `password_wo`, you must also update the `password_wo_version`. May be required depending on used os.
- `password_wo_version` - (Optional) The version of the [write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/write-only) password. To update the `password_wo`, you must also update the `password_wo_version`.
- `service_user` - (Optional) User used for the service to install.
- `service_password` - (Optional) Password used for the service to install. May be required depending on used os. Only one of `service_password` or `service_password_wo` should be specified.
- `service_password_wo` - (Optional) Password used for the service to install in [write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/write-only) mode. Only one of `service_password` or `service_password_wo` should be specified. `service_password_wo` will not be set in the Terraform state. To update the `service_password_wo`, you must also update the `service_password_wo_version`. May be required depending on used os.
- `service_password_wo_version` - (Optional) The version of the [write-only](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/manage-sensitive-data/write-only) service password. To update the `service_password_wo`, you must also update the `service_password_wo_version`.
- `reinstall_on_config_changes` - (Optional) If True, this boolean allows to reinstall the server on install config changes.
  ~> **Important:** Updates to `ssh_key_ids`, `user`, `password`, `service_user` or `service_password` will not take effect on the server, it requires to reinstall it. To do so please set 'reinstall_on_config_changes' argument to true.
- `install_config_afterward` - (Optional) If True, this boolean allows to create a server without the install config if you want to provide it later.
- `name` - (Optional) The name of the server.
- `hostname` - (Optional) The hostname of the server.
- `description` - (Optional) A description for the server.
- `tags` - (Optional) The tags associated with the server.
- `options` - (Optional) The options to enable on the server.
  ~> The `options` block supports:
    - `id` - (Required) The id of the option to enable. Use [this endpoint](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/elastic-metal/#path-options-list-options) to find the available options IDs.
    - `expires_at` - (Optional) The auto expiration date for compatible options
- `private_network` - (Required) The private networks to attach to the server. For more information, see [the documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/elastic-metal/how-to/use-private-networks/)
    - `id` - (Required) The id of the private network to attach.
    - `ipam_ip_ids` - (Optional) List of IPAM IP IDs to assign to the server in the requested private network.
- `zone` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#zone) `zone`) The [zone](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#zones) in which the server should be created.
- `partitioning` (Optional) The partitioning schema in JSON format
- `cloud_init` - (Optional) Configuration data to pass to cloud-init such as a YAML cloud config or a user-data script. Accepts either a string containing the content or a path to a file (for example `file("cloud-init.yml")`). Max length: 127998 characters. Updates to `cloud_init` will update the server user-data via the API and do not trigger a reinstall; however, a reboot of the server is required for the OS to re-run cloud-init and apply the changes. Only supported for Offers that have cloud-init enabled. You can check available offers with `scw baremetal list offers` command.
- `protected` - (Optional) Set to true to activate server protection option.
- `project_id` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#project_id) `project_id`) The ID of the project the server is associated with.
