# Resource: scaleway_key_manager_key

Provides a Scaleway Key Manager Key resource.  
This resource allows you to create and manage cryptographic keys in Scaleway Key Manager (KMS).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "scaleway_key_manager_key" "main" {
  name         = "my-kms-key"
  region       = "fr-par"
  project_id   = "your-project-id" # optional, will use provider default if omitted
  usage        = "symmetric_encryption"
  description  = "Key for encrypting secrets"
  tags         = ["env:prod", "kms"]
  unprotected  = true

  rotation_policy {
    rotation_period = "720h" # 30 days
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `name` (String) – The name of the key.  
- `region` (String) – The region in which to create the key (e.g., `fr-par`).  
- `project_id` (String, Optional) – The ID of the project the key belongs to.  
- `usage` (String, **Required**) – The usage of the key. Valid values are:
    - `symmetric_encryption`
    - `asymmetric_encryption`
    - `asymmetric_signing`
- `description` (String, Optional) – A description for the key.
- `tags` (List of String, Optional) – A list of tags to assign to the key.
- `unprotected` (Boolean, Optional) – If `true`, the key can be deleted. Defaults to `false` (protected).
- `origin` (String, Optional) – The origin of the key. Valid values are:
    - `scaleway_kms` (default)
    - `external`
- `rotation_policy` (Block, Optional) – Rotation policy for the key:
    - `rotation_period` (String, Optional) – The period between key rotations (e.g., `"720h"` for 30 days).

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` – The ID of the key.
- `state` – The state of the key (e.g., `enabled`).
- `created_at` – The date and time when the key was created.
- `updated_at` – The date and time when the key was last updated.
- `rotation_count` – The number of times the key has been rotated.
- `protected` – Whether the key is protected from deletion.
- `locked` – Whether the key is locked.
- `rotated_at` – The date and time when the key was last rotated.
- `origin_read` – The origin of the key as returned by the API.
- `region_read` – The region of the key as returned by the API.
- `rotation_policy` (Block)
    - `rotation_period` – The period between key rotations.
    - `next_rotation_at` – The date and time of the next scheduled rotation.

## Import

You can import a key using its ID and region:

```shell
terraform import scaleway_key_manager_key.main fr-par/11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555
```

## Notes

- **Protection**: By default, keys are protected and cannot be deleted. To allow deletion, set `unprotected = true` when creating the key.
- **Rotation Policy**: The `rotation_policy` block allows you to set automatic rotation for your key.
- **Origin**: The `origin` argument is optional and defaults to `scaleway_kms`. Use `external` if you want to import an external key (see Scaleway documentation for details).
- **Project and Region**: If not specified, `project_id` and `region` will default to the provider configuration.

## Example: Asymmetric Key

```terraform
resource "scaleway_key_manager_key" "asym" {
  name        = "asymmetric-key"
  region      = "fr-par"
  usage       = "asymmetric_signing"
  description = "Key for signing documents"
  unprotected = true
}
```
