# Resource: scaleway_key_manager_key

Provides a Scaleway Key Manager Key resource.  
This resource allows you to create and manage cryptographic keys in Scaleway Key Manager (KMS).

## Example Usage

### Symmetric Encryption Key

```terraform
resource "scaleway_key_manager_key" "symmetric" {
  name        = "my-kms-key"
  region      = "fr-par"
  project_id  = "your-project-id" # optional, will use provider default if omitted
  usage       = "symmetric_encryption"
  algorithm   = "aes_256_gcm"
  description = "Key for encrypting secrets"
  tags        = ["env:prod", "kms"]
  unprotected = true

  rotation_policy {
    rotation_period = "720h" # 30 days
  }
}
```

### Asymmetric Encryption Key with RSA-4096

```terraform
resource "scaleway_key_manager_key" "rsa_4096" {
  name        = "rsa-4096-key"
  region      = "fr-par"
  usage       = "asymmetric_encryption"
  algorithm   = "rsa_oaep_4096_sha256"
  description = "Key for encrypting large files with RSA-4096"
  unprotected = true
}
```

### Asymmetric Signing Key

```terraform
resource "scaleway_key_manager_key" "signing" {
  name        = "signing-key"
  region      = "fr-par"
  usage       = "asymmetric_signing"
  algorithm   = "rsa_pss_2048_sha256"
  description = "Key for signing documents"
  unprotected = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `name` (String) – The name of the key.  
- `region` (String) – The region in which to create the key (e.g., `fr-par`).  
- `project_id` (String, Optional) – The ID of the project the key belongs to.

**Key Usage and Algorithm (both required):**

- `usage` (String, Required) – The usage type of the key. Valid values:
    - `symmetric_encryption` – For symmetric encryption operations
    - `asymmetric_encryption` – For asymmetric encryption operations
    - `asymmetric_signing` – For digital signing operations

- `algorithm` (String, Required) – The cryptographic algorithm to use. Valid values depend on the `usage`:
    - For `symmetric_encryption`:
        - `aes_256_gcm`
    - For `asymmetric_encryption`:
        - `rsa_oaep_2048_sha256`
        - `rsa_oaep_3072_sha256`
        - `rsa_oaep_4096_sha256`
    - For `asymmetric_signing`:
        - `ec_p256_sha256`
        - `rsa_pss_2048_sha256`
        - `rsa_pkcs1_2048_sha256`

**Other arguments:**

- `description` (String, Optional) – A description for the key.
- `tags` (List of String, Optional) – A list of tags to assign to the key.
- `unprotected` (Boolean, Optional) – If `true`, the key can be deleted. Defaults to `false` (protected).
- `origin` (String, Optional) – The origin of the key. Valid values are:
    - `scaleway_kms` (default)
    - `external`
- `rotation_policy` (Block, Optional) – Rotation policy for the key:
    - `rotation_period` (String, Optional) – The period between key rotations (e.g., `"720h"` for 30 days).

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` – The ID of the key.
- `state` – The state of the key (e.g., `enabled`).
- `created_at` – The date and time when the key was created.
- `updated_at` – The date and time when the key was last updated.
- `rotation_count` – The number of times the key has been rotated.
- `protected` – Whether the key is protected from deletion.
- `locked` – Whether the key is locked.
- `rotated_at` – The date and time when the key was last rotated.
- `rotation_policy` (Block)
    - `rotation_period` – The period between key rotations.
    - `next_rotation_at` – The date and time of the next scheduled rotation.

## Import

You can import a key using its ID and region:

```shell
terraform import scaleway_key_manager_key.main fr-par/11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555
```

## Notes

- **Protection**: By default, keys are protected and cannot be deleted. To allow deletion, set `unprotected = true` when creating the key.
- **Rotation Policy**: The `rotation_policy` block allows you to set automatic rotation for your key.
- **Origin**: The `origin` argument is optional and defaults to `scaleway_kms`. Use `external` if you want to import an external key (see Scaleway documentation for details).
- **Project and Region**: If not specified, `project_id` and `region` will default to the provider configuration.
- **Algorithm Validation**: The provider validates that the specified `algorithm` is compatible with the `usage` type at plan time, providing early feedback on configuration errors.
