## Example Usage

### Basic

```terraform
resource "scaleway_vpc" "vpc01" {
name = "my vpc"
}

resource "scaleway_vpc_private_network" "pn01" {
vpc_id = scaleway_vpc.vpc01.id
ipv4_subnet {
subnet = "172.16.32.0/22"
}
}

resource "scaleway_ipam_ip" "ip01" {
address = "172.16.32.7"
source {
private_network_id = scaleway_vpc_private_network.pn01.id
}
}

resource "scaleway_lb" "lb01" {
name = "test-lb-private-network"
type = "LB-S"
}

resource "scaleway_lb_private_network" "lbpn01" {
lb_id              = scaleway_lb.lb01.id
private_network_id = scaleway_vpc_private_network.pn01.id
ipam_ip_ids        = [scaleway_ipam_ip.ip01.id]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `zone` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#zone) `zone`) The [zone](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#zones) in which the Private Network should be attached.
- `project_id` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#project_id) `project_id`) The ID of the Project the Private Network attachment is associated with.
- `lb_id` - (Required) The load-balancer ID to attach the private network to.
- `private_network_id` - (Required) The private network ID to attach.
- `ipam_ip_ids` - (Required) The IPAM ID of a pre-reserved IP address to assign to the Load Balancer on this Private Network.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The ID of the Private Network attachment, which is of the form `{zone}/{lb-id}/{private-network-id}` e.g. `fr-par-1/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`

- `created_at` -  The date and time of the creation of the Private Network attachment (RFC 3339 format).
- `updated_at` -  The date and time of the last update of the Private Network attachment (RFC 3339 format).

## Import

Private Network attachments can be imported using `{zone}/{lb-id}/{private-network-id}`, e.g.

```bash
terraform import scaleway_lb_private_network.lbpn01 fr-par-1/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
