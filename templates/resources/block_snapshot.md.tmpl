# Resource: scaleway_block_snapshot

The `scaleway_block_snapshot` resource is used to create and manage snapshots of Block Storage volumes.

Refer to the Block Storage [product documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/block-storage/) and [API documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/block/) for more information.

## Example Usage

### Create a snapshot of a Block Storage volume

The following command allows you to create a snapshot (`some-snapshot-name`) from a Block Storage volume specified by its ID.

```terraform
resource "scaleway_block_volume" "block_volume" {
  iops       = 5000
  name       = "some-volume-name"
  size_in_gb = 20
}

resource "scaleway_block_snapshot" "block_snapshot" {
  name      = "some-snapshot-name"
  volume_id = scaleway_block_volume.block_volume.id
}
```

### How to import from Object Storage

```terraform
resource "scaleway_object_bucket" "my-import-bucket" {
  name = "snapshot-bucket-to-import"
}

resource "scaleway_object" "qcow-object" {
  bucket = scaleway_object_bucket.snapshot-bucket.name
  key    = "my-snapshot.qcow2"
  file   = "imported-snapshot/snapshot.qcow2"
}
resource "scaleway_block_volume" "imported" {
  iops = 5000
  name = "imported-from-qcow"

  import {
    bucket = "my-import-bucket"
    key    = "imported-snapshot/snapshot.qcow2"
  }
}
```

### How to export to Object Storage

```terraform
resource "scaleway_object_bucket" "my-import-bucket" {
      name = "snapshot-bucket-to-import"
}

resource "scaleway_object" "qcow-object" {
      bucket = scaleway_object_bucket.snapshot-bucket.name
      key    = "export/my-snapshot.qcow2"
}

resource "scaleway_block_volume" "to_export" {
  iops = 5000
  name = "to-export"

  export {
    bucket = "snapshot-bucket-to-import"
    key    = "exports/my-snapshot.qcow2"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

This section lists the arguments that are supported:

- `volume_id` - (Optional) The ID of the volume to take a snapshot from.
- `name` - (Optional) The name of the snapshot. If not provided, a name will be randomly generated.
- `zone` - (Defaults to the zone specified in the [provider configuration](../index.md#zone)). The [zone](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#zones) in which the snapshot should be created.
- `project_id` - (Defaults to the Project ID specified in the [provider configuration](../index.md#project_id)). The ID of the Scaleway Project the snapshot is associated with.
- `tags` - (Optional) A list of tags to apply to the snapshot.
- `import` - (Optional)  Use this block to import a QCOW image from Object Storage to create a volume.
      - `bucket` – (Required) The name of the bucket containing the QCOW file.
      - `key` – (Required) The key of the QCOW file within the bucket.
- `export` - (Optional) Use this block to export the volume as a QCOW file to Object Storage.
      - `bucket` – (Required) The name of the bucket where the QCOW file will be saved.
      - `key` – (Required) The desired key (path) for the QCOW file within the bucket.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The ID of the snapshot.

~> **Important:** The IDs of Block Storage volumes snapshots are [zoned](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#resource-ids), meaning that the zone is part of the ID, in the form `{zone}/{id}`. For example, a snapshot ID might be `fr-par-1/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`.

## Import

This section explains how to import the snapshot of a Block Storage volume using the zoned ID format (`{zone}/{id}`).

```bash
terraform import scaleway_block_snapshot.main fr-par-1/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```
