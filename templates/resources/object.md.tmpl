# Resource: scaleway_object

The `scaleway_object` resource allows you to create and manage objects for [Scaleway Object storage](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/object-storage/).

Refer to the [dedicated documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/object-storage/how-to/upload-files-into-a-bucket/) for more information on Object Storage objects.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "scaleway_object_bucket" "some_bucket" {
  name = "some-unique-name"
}

resource scaleway_object "some_file" {
  bucket = scaleway_object_bucket.some_bucket.id
  key    = "object_path"

  file = "myfile"
  hash = filemd5("myfile")
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `bucket` - (Required) The name of the bucket, or its Terraform ID.

* `key` - (Required) The path to the object.

* `file` - (Optional) The name of the file to upload, defaults to an empty file.

* `content` - (Optional) The content of the file to upload. Only one of `file`, `content` or `content_base64` can be defined.

* `content_base64` - (Optional) The base64-encoded content of the file to upload. Only one of `file`, `content` or `content_base64` can be defined.

-> **Note:** Only one of `file`, `content` or `content_base64` can be defined.

* `hash` - (Optional) Hash of the file, used to trigger the upload on file change.

* `storage_class` - (Optional) Specifies the Scaleway [storage class](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/object-storage/concepts/#storage-class) (`STANDARD`, `GLACIER`, or `ONEZONE_IA`) used to store the object.

* `visibility` - (Optional) Visibility of the object, `public-read` or `private`.

* `metadata` - (Optional) Map of metadata used for the object (keys must be lowercase).

* `content_type` -  (Optional) The standard MIME type of the object's content (e.g., 'application/json', 'text/plain'). This specifies how the object should be interpreted by clients. See RFC 9110: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-content-type

* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags.

* `sse_customer_key` - (Optional) Customer's encryption keys to encrypt data (SSE-C)

* `project_id` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#arguments-reference) `project_id`) The ID of the project the bucket is associated with.

~> **Important:** The `project_id` attribute has a particular behavior with s3 products because the s3 API is scoped by project.
If you are using a project different from the default one, you have to specify the `project_id` for every child resource of the bucket,
like objects. Otherwise, Terraform will try to create the child resource with the default project ID and you will get a 403 error.

## Attributes Reference

The `scaleway_object` resource exports certain attributes once the object is retrieved. These attributes can be referenced in other parts of your Terraform configuration.

* `id` - The path of the object, including the name of the bucket.

~> **Important:** Object IDs are [regional](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#resource-ids), which means they are of the form `{region}/{bucket-name}/{key}`, e.g. `fr-par/bucket-name/object-key`.

* `region` - The Scaleway [region](../guides/regions_and_zones.md) the bucket resides in.

## Import

Objects can be imported using the `{region}/{bucketName}/{objectKey}` identifier, as shown below:

```bash
terraform import scaleway_object.some_object fr-par/some-bucket/some-file
```

~> **Important:** The `project_id` attribute has a particular behavior with s3 products because the s3 API is scoped by project.
If you are using a project different from the default one, you have to specify the project ID at the end of the import command.

```bash
terraform import scaleway_object.some_object fr-par/some-bucket/some-file@xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx
```
