# Resource: scaleway_tem_domain_validation

This Terraform resource manages the validation of domains for use with Scaleway's Transactional Email Management (TEM) service. It ensures that domains used for sending emails are verified and comply with Scaleway's requirements for email sending.
For more information refer to the [API documentation](https://developers.scaleway.com/en/products/transactional_email/api/).

## Example Usage

### Basic

```terraform
resource "scaleway_tem_domain" "main" {
  accept_tos = true
  name       = "example.com"
}

resource "scaleway_tem_domain_validation" "example" {
  domain_id = scaleway_tem_domain.main.id
  region    = "fr-par"
  timeout   = 300
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `domain_id` - (Required) The ID of the domain name used when sending emails. This ID must correspond to a domain already registered with Scaleway's Transactional Email service.

- `region` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#region) `region`). Specifies the [region](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#regions) where the domain is registered. If not specified, it defaults to the provider's region.

- `timeout` - (Optional) The maximum wait time in seconds before returning an error if the domain validation does not complete. The default is 300 seconds.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:
