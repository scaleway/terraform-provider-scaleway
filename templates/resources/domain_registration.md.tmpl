# Resource: scaleway_domain_registration

The `scaleway_domain_registration` resource allows you to purchase and manage domain registrations with Scaleway. Using this resource you can register one or more domains for a specified duration, configure auto-renewal and DNSSEC options, and set contact information. You can supply an owner contact either by providing an existing contact ID or by specifying the complete contact details. The resource automatically returns additional contact information (administrative and technical) as provided by the Scaleway API.

Refer to the [Domains and DNS documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/network/domains-and-dns/) and the [API documentation](https://developers.scaleway.com/) for more details.

## Example Usage

### Purchase a Single Domain

The following example purchases a domain with a one-year registration period and specifies the owner contact details. Administrative and technical contacts are returned by the API.

```terraform
resource "scaleway_domain_registration" "test" {
  domain_names      = ["example.com"]
  duration_in_years = 1

  owner_contact {
    legal_form                  = "individual"
    firstname                   = "John"
    lastname                    = "DOE"
    email                       = "john.doe@example.com"
    phone_number                = "+1.23456789"
    address_line_1              = "123 Main Street"
    city                        = "Paris"
    zip                         = "75001"
    country                     = "FR"
    vat_identification_code     = "FR12345678901"
    company_identification_code = "123456789"
  }
}
```

### Update Domain Settings

You can update the resource to enable auto-renewal and DNSSEC:

```terraform
resource "scaleway_domain_registration" "test" {
  domain_names      = ["example.com"]
  duration_in_years = 1

  owner_contact {
    legal_form                  = "individual"
    firstname                   = "John"
    lastname                    = "DOE"
    email                       = "john.doe@example.com"
    phone_number                = "+1.23456789"
    address_line_1              = "123 Main Street"
    city                        = "Paris"
    zip                         = "75001"
    country                     = "FR"
    vat_identification_code     = "FR12345678901"
    company_identification_code = "123456789"
  }

  auto_renew = true
  dnssec     = true
}
```

### Purchase Multiple Domains

The following example registers several domains in one go:

```terraform
resource "scaleway_domain_registration" "multi" {
  domain_names      = ["domain1.com", "domain2.com", "domain3.com"]
  duration_in_years = 1

  owner_contact {
    legal_form                  = "individual"
    firstname                   = "John"
    lastname                    = "DOE"
    email                       = "john.doe@example.com"
    phone_number                = "+1.23456789"
    address_line_1              = "123 Main Street"
    city                        = "Paris"
    zip                         = "75001"
    country                     = "FR"
    vat_identification_code     = "FR12345678901"
    company_identification_code = "123456789"
  }
