# Resource: scaleway_instance_ip

{{ .Description }}

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "scaleway_instance_ip" "server_ip" {}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `type` - The type of the IP (`routed_ipv4`, `routed_ipv6`), more information in [the documentation](https://www.scaleway.com/en/docs/compute/instances/api-cli/using-routed-ips/)
- `zone` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#zone) `zone`) The [zone](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#zones) in which the IP should be reserved.
- `project_id` - (Defaults to [provider](../index.md#project_id) `project_id`) The ID of the project the IP is associated with.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - The ID of the IP.

~> **Important:** Instance IPs' IDs are [zoned](../guides/regions_and_zones.md#resource-ids), which means they are of the form `{zone}/{id}`, e.g. `fr-par-1/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111`

- `address` - The IP address.

~> **Important:** For IPv6 addresses, the full address is not readable from the "scaleway_instance_ip" resource, only the prefix.
To get the full address, the IP must be attached to another resource and read from the latter.
For example, for a server, the address will be listed in the "public_ips" or "private_ips" attribute of the "scaleway_instance_server".

- `prefix` - The IP Prefix.
- `reverse` - The reverse dns attached to this IP
- `organization_id` - The organization ID the IP is associated with.
- `tags` - The tags associated with the IP.

## Import

IPs can be imported using the `{zone}/{id}`, e.g.

```bash
terraform import scaleway_instance_ip.server_ip fr-par-1/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111
```
