# Scaleway Provider

The Scaleway provider is used to manage Scaleway resources.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Here is an example that will setup the following:
* A Server.
* An IP Address.
* A security group.

(create this as `sl.tf` and run terraform commands from this directory):

```hcl
provider "scaleway" {
  organization = "<YOUR-ORGANIZATION-ID>"
  token        = "<YOUR-SECRET-TOKEN>"
  region       = "par1"
}

resource "scaleway_ip" "ip" {
  server = "${scaleway_server.test.id}"
}

resource "scaleway_server" "test" {
  name  = "test"
  image = "aecaed73-51a5-4439-a127-6d8229847145"
  type  = "C2S"
}

resource "scaleway_volume" "test" {
  name       = "test"
  size_in_gb = 50
  type       = "l_ssd"
}

resource "scaleway_volume_attachment" "test" {
  server = "${scaleway_server.test.id}"
  volume = "${scaleway_volume.test.id}"
}

resource "scaleway_security_group" "http" {
  name        = "http"
  description = "allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic"
}

resource "scaleway_security_group_rule" "http_accept" {
  security_group = "${scaleway_security_group.http.id}"

  action    = "accept"
  direction = "inbound"
  ip_range  = "0.0.0.0/0"
  protocol  = "TCP"
  port      = 80
}

resource "scaleway_security_group_rule" "https_accept" {
  security_group = "${scaleway_security_group.http.id}"

  action    = "accept"
  direction = "inbound"
  ip_range  = "0.0.0.0/0"
  protocol  = "TCP"
  port      = 443
}
```

You'll need to provide your Scaleway **organization ID** and a **secret token**. Both are
UUIDs.

Your **organization ID** can be found in the *Account* tab of the Scaleway control panel. It
is labeled "Organization ID". Alternatively, if you already have a **secret token** you can
issue a request to the Scaleway API directly and query for your **organization ID**:
```shell
$ curl https://account.scaleway.com/organizations -H "X-Auth-Token: <YOUR-SECRET-TOKEN>"
```

A **secret token** can be generated by visiting the *Credentials* tab of the Scaleway
control panel and looking in the *Tokens* section at the bottom of the page. Each listed
"Secret Key" (if any tokens have already been created) can be used as your **secret token**.
Since secret keys are only revealed one time (when the token is first created) you might
need to create a new token to get a new "Secret Key". Giving each token a friendly-name
is recommended.

If you do not want to put credentials in your configuration file,
you can leave them out:

```
provider "scaleway" {
  region       = "par1"
}
```

...and instead set these environment variables:

- **SCALEWAY_ORGANIZATION**: Your Scaleway `organization` ID
- **SCALEWAY_TOKEN**: Your API access `token`, generated by you
- **SCALEWAY_REGION**: The Scaleway region

## Volume usage

You can add volumes to bare metal instances.
The minimal size of increment is 50GB and you can add at most 15 different volumes on an instance.

Additional volumes cannot be added to virtual cloud servers.

Check out the list of different instances on the [pricing page](https://www.scaleway.com/pricing).

## Scaleway S3-compatible

[Scaleway object storage](https://www.scaleway.com/object-storage/) can be used to store your Terraform state.
Configure your backend as:

```
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket      = "terraform_state"
    key         = "my_state.tfstate"
    region      = "nl-ams"
    endpoint    = "https://s3.nl-ams.scw.cloud"
    access_key  = "SCWXYZ"
    secret_key  = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    skip_credentials_validation = true
    skip_region_validation = true
  }
}
```

Beware as no locking mechanism are yet supported.
Using scaleway object storage as terraform backend is not suitable if you work in a team with à risk of simultaneously access to the same plan.
