Creates and manages Scaleway compute Instance User Data values.

User data is a key value store API you can use to provide data from and to your server without authentication. It is the mechanism by which a user can pass information contained in a local file to an Instance at launch time.

The typical use case is to pass something like a shell script or a configuration file as user data.
